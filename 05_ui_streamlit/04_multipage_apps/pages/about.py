Hi, I've been a web and mobile app developer for 5 years. I specialize in front-end and back-end development. I have strong knowledge and experience in the following:

âœ” JavaScript, Python\n
âœ” NextJS, ReactJS, React Native, Redux\n
âœ” Drizzle ORM, Prisma ORM\n
âœ” Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Ant Design, BlueprintJS, Semantic UI, Material UI\n
âœ” HTML5, CSS3 with LESS/SCSS, SVG, canvas, animation\n
âœ” Firebase, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL\n
âœ” npm, yarn and pretty much all modern JS tooling\n

At the moment I specialize in React.js/Next.js and everything related. I put a lot of attention to UI and UX, I enjoy tinkering over small details to deliver the best possible product to my clients and end-users.

As a freelance contractor, I take my job very seriously - I not only deliver a final product but I also think about how it will be maintained afterward. My goal is to build long-term mutually beneficial relationships with my clients so we will be able to work again later.

Please don't hesitate to drop me a message if you think that I can be a good fit for your project. I will be glad to be of help
